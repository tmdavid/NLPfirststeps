# @tmdavid
# I'll be tryin to implement some simple Natural language processing algorithms
# This is as well on of my first times using python, so it will be a mix of many things.
# Also I'll try to create everything from scratch. Project scope is not to create the best algorithms, the faster or the        # anything, its just to explore NLP algorithms, aswell as to explore diferent python libraries, such as ElementTree to work with xml.
# Documentation will be in progress.
